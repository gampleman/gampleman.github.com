My Personal site
================

Site inspired by work done by [Tim Van Dame](http://timvandamme.com/). Icons from [Komodo Media](http://www.komodomedia.com).

If you have any comments or suggestions please leave a note at [the Notable page](http://gampleman.notableapp.com/website-feedback/23206/Jakub-Hampl-Info).

This site had most of it's widgetry done by hand, but has been re-factored extensively to use the fabulous [jQuery Tools library](http://flowplayer.org/tools/index.html), which was included anyway. This made the source code about six times shorter (a mere 100 loc), and added some features as well, eg. browser back button support.

How was this done
-----------------

Programmed in TextMate, designed in DrawIt, styled in CSSEdit and most of the fancy scripting comes from the JQuery TOOLS library. Some additional edits done in Pixelmator.

Testing
-------

Tested in Safari :) and somewhat in some versions of FF. It shows a nasty message to IE < 7 users.

License
-------

You may use the js code (master.js) and CSS in any way you like (and don't hold me responsible, etc.). 
The html's text is mine and may not be used without my explicit consent. However you may use the structure
for your own needs and just add your own copywriting. Also the images are mine and may not be used.

The jQuery tools library is governed by it's own license as well as the Social Icons.

Support
-------

Also if you use any of this work a link would be nice, but it doesn't have to be on every page etc. Just in 
an about page or if hosted on GitHub on the README.

Alternatively, the next time you shop on Amazon, use [this link](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2F&tag=ebooks036-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957). It's not much, but it helps.
