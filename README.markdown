My Personal site
================

Site inspired by work done by [Tim Van Dame](http://timvandamme.com/). Icons from [Komodo Media](http://www.komodomedia.com).

This site had most of it's widgetry done by hand, but has been re-factored extensively to use the faboulus [jQuery Tools library](http://flowplayer.org/tools/index.html), which was included anyway. This made the source code about six times shorter, and added some features as well, eg. browser back button support.

How was this done
-----------------

Programmed in TextMate, designed in DrawIt, styled in CSSEdit and most of the fancy scripting comes from the JQuery TOOLS library.

Testing
-------

Tested in Safari :) and somewhat in some version of FF. It shows a nasty message to IE < 7 users.
